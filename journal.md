The way that computer science impacts my life is my apple watch and its a big part of my whole routine because i  am very active as a teen espically since i have two football practices a day and i like to know how much calories i burned and if i worked harder today then yesterday and i like to track my calories so i can put all the weight i burned off right back on my body
